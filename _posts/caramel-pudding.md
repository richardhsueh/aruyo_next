### Steps

1. add the caramel portion sugar and water to a small pot
2. use low heat to cook the sugar until it turns to caramel
3. When the caramel is ready, divide the caramel evenly to the ramekin, DON'T wash the pot at this point
4. Add the milk and cream to the pot, heat the mixture to melt all remaining caramel and turn off the heat just before boil
5. Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk it
6. Add the remaining sugar and vanilla extract to the beaten egg
7. Mix the milk mixture with the egg mixture
8. Sift the mixture 5 times to remove air bubble
9. divide the mixture into the ramekins
10. steam it for 20 mins with low heat
11. store in the fridge for a few days, allow the caramel to dissolve
12. Done

### Remark

- wait around 20s before dividing the caramel into the ramekins, it helps prevent bubble forming
- ideally wait for 3 days before eating the pudding, allow the caramel dissolve completely
