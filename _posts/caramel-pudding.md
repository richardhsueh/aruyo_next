### Steps

1. Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk it
2. Add the pudding portion sugar to the beaten egg, mix well and set aside
3. Next add the caramel portion sugar and water to a small pot
4. use low heat to cook the sugar until it turns to caramel
5. When the caramel is ready, remove from heat, divide the caramel evenly to the ramekin, DON'T wash the pot at this point
6. Add the milk to the pot, heat the milk to melt all remaining caramel and turn off the heat just before boil
7. Mix the warm milk mixture with the egg mixture, stir well
8. Add the vanilla extract and rum to the mixture
9. Remove air bubble by passing the mixture through sifter 5 times
10. divide the mixture into the ramekins
11. steam it for 10 mins with low heat
12. after 10 mins, the pudding should be set, if not, turn off the heat, let it cover for few extra minutes
13. store in the fridge for a few days, allow the caramel to dissolve completely
14. Done

### Remark

- wait around 20s before dividing the caramel into the ramekins, it helps prevent bubble forming
- ideally wait for 3 days before eating the pudding, allow the caramel dissolve completely
- the steaming duration may varies base on what kind of mould you're using
