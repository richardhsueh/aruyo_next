10. divide the mixture into the ramekins
11. steam it for 10 mins with low heat
12. after 10 mins, the pudding should be set, if not, turn off the heat, let it cover for few extra minutes

- ideally wait for 3 days before eating the pudding, allow the caramel dissolve completely
- the steaming duration may varies base on what kind of mould you're using
