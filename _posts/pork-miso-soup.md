### Steps

1. First peel the onion, carrot and turnip
2. Half the carrot and turnip, cut into thin slice and set aside
3. Also slice the onion and shitaki mushroom into thin strip
4. Cut the pork belly strip into shorter strip if it is too long
5. After washing the konjac jelly, use a fork to divide into smaller pieces
6. Add some oil in a pot and fry the pork belly strip first, just lightly brown it
7. Next, add the onion, mushroom, carrot and turnip, continue frying for 2-3 mins
8. Add enough water to cover all the ingredient
9. Add konjac jelly and wait for the soup to boil
10. Skim off any scum appear on the surface
11. When there is no more scum, add the miso and mix well
12. Continue simmer for additional 30 mins to soften the carrot and turnip
13. Done


### Remark
- the reason of using fork is to create mote surface area to absorb more flavour form the soup
- if you want, you can serve with chop green onion
