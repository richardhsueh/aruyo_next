### Steps

1. Thinly slice the onion, set aside
2. grate the garlic and ginger, set aside
3. Measure out all the spices
4. Add some vegetable oil to a pot, along with the whole spice, use low-medium heat to toast the spice. When the seed start to pop, move on to nex step
5. add the grated garlic and ginger to the pot, continue frying until garlic and ginger turn slightly golden brown
6. add the onion, half of the salt and 2-3 tablespoons of water, cover the pot and turn the heat to high, the goal is to soften the onion and help the caramelization
7. Check on the onion occasionally, don't let it burn
8. When all the onion turn golden brown, add the tomato puree, continue stirring until the moisture from tomato puree are almost evaporated
9. Turn to low heat and add the spice powder and continue cooking until most of the moisture has been evaporated
10. And then turn the heat high and add chicken stock to de-glaze the pot
11. Next, add tangerine juice and coconut milk, cover the pot and continue simmer on low heat for 5 mins
12. Meanwhile, sear the meat in another fry pan, lightly season with the rest of the salt. No need to completely cook the chicken, we just want a nice sear on the surface
13. When the meat is ready, add the meat to the curry sauce, keep the heat on low and simmer the curry
14. It's ready when the meat is completely cooked and tender.
15. Serve with rice
