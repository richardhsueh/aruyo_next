### Steps

1. Finely dice the onion, set aside
2. Sear all the oxtail pieces in a large pot, until golden brown at the surface, set aside when it's ready
3. In the same pot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt to help soften onion, stir fry until slightly brown
4. When onion is ready, add tomato puree and continue cooking to cook off the sourness of the puree
5. Once Tomato puree has been cooked off, add sake
6. Let them GENTLY simmer until all the vegetables are completely cooked to almost melting consistency. Stir well once every 5-10 mins to avoid bottom of the pot to be burnt.
7. Add mirin, soy sauce and honey and mix well.
8. Add the oxtail at this stage
9. Bring them back to boil on gentle heat. Once start to boil, add butter and mix well to emulsify.
10. Keep simmer for further 2-3 hour over GENTLE heat. Stir well once every 5-10 mins to avoid bottom of the pot to be burnt.
11. Until the oxtail reach the desired tenderness
12. Done

- if you want better mouth feel, blitz the sauce with hand blender
- or even pass through chinois
